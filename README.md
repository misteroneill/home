# misteroneill/home

My OS X user directory files/setup.

## Dependencies

- Xcode Command Line Tools + Git

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
1. Run one/all of the scripts.

## Scripts

Each script can be run independently. Most have opposite `un` versions (e.g. `dotfiles.sh` can be reversed with `undotfiles.sh`).

- `dotfiles.sh`: Set up important files in the `$HOME` directory.
- `node.sh`: Set up nvm, Node, and npm in various versions.
- `sublime.sh`: Sets up preferences for Sublime Text. _It is best for ST and Package Control to be installed before-hand!_
- `undotfiles.sh`: Reverses `dotfiles.sh` changes
- `unnode.sh`: Reverses `node.sh` changes
