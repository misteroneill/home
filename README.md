# misteroneill/home

My OS X user directory files/setup.

## Dependencies

- Xcode Command Line Tools + Git
- Assumes you're using the default `zsh` instead of `bash`
- Assumes you've installed Sublime Text _and_ Package Control

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
1. Run one/all of the scripts.

## Scripts

Each script can be run independently.

- `dotfiles.sh`: Set up important files in the `$HOME` directory.
- `node.sh`: Set up nvm and Node in various recent versions.
- `sublime.sh`: Depends on `node` being installed (which `node.sh` does). Sets up my preferred defaults for Sublime Text.
